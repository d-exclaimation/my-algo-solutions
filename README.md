# My Optimzed and Unoptimized solutions for common algorithm questions

Answers here are not perfect, some of them are not optimized, because I couldn't care less to try again

I am just collecting them together, so I don't lose them and have this messy

I use multiple languages, so yeah:

> `rust` (the one I have been using recently, to better understand how everything unfolds)
> `go` (I just like the language)
> `typescript` (Idk) [TODO: Find them]
> `swift` (I used to mainly use this) [TODO: Find them]
> `python` (I think I lost this one, lol :) )
